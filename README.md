# FloatLayoutProject

That's my first project in when i used old float layout. I did it to known how the websites was build in the past.

## I learn a lot about:
* BEM ( BLOCK ELEMNT MODIFIER) 
* 7-1 Pattern
* CSS stuff like clip-path, background-clip etc.
* Float layout and how to make own custom grid
* Clearfix class which is necessary with float layout.
